# MyHome
The custom MyHome repository of the user will be cloned in here. This repository should contain all your tracked home directors files, for eg. .zsh, .ssh-config or .ansible, since they will be automatically moved into the home directory.

ATTENTION: Secret or private files, like SSH and GPG keys should alway be encrypted before committing them into a repository. To be more secure you can use a separate repository "MySecrets" for private and secret files or use a password manager like Bitwarden.
